# Coupled Dynamical Systems Simulations

This repository contains simulations of two coupled dynamical systems, providing insights into nonlinear dynamics and coupled oscillatory behavior:

- **Double Pendulum**: A simulation of the chaotic motion of a double pendulum, illustrating the sensitivity to initial conditions and dynamics of this classic nonlinear system.
- **Coupled Oscillators**: A simulation of two coupled oscillators, demonstrating energy transfer between the oscillators and resonance effects.

These simulations highlight the interesting behavior of coupled systems and their relevance in physics.
